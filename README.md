I was inspired by Marielle Semente’s project on OpenProcessing, where pixel dots scatter and reform into a pixelated image. I plan to adapt this visual style—dots dispersing like fireworks—for my "Wheels of Fortune" piece. I find the bouncing interaction of the dots, especially when they hit the screen edges, engaging and relevant to the techniques we explored in Week 6. This approach not only adds visual intrigue but also enhances interactivity, aligning well with the creative goals of the assignment.

I discovered a JavaScript library on CSS Script that transforms an image into customizable particles responsive to mouse and touch interactions. I plan to adapt its use of getImageData() to extract pixel color data and generate interactive particles. This technique will allow the circular patterns in  “Wheels of Fortune” to disperse like fireworks in response to user input visually. It effectively bridges image-based pixel analysis with interactive animation, aligning with both the aesthetic and interactive goals of the assignment.
